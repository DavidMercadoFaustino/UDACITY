Introduction
Before we dive into writing Structured Query Language (SQL) queries, let's take a look at what makes SQL and the databases that utilize SQL so popular.

I think it is an important distinction to say that SQL is a language. Hence, the last word of SQL being language. SQL is used all over the place beyond the databases we will utilize in this class. With that being said, SQL is most popular for its interaction with databases. For this class, you can think of a database as a bunch of excel spreadsheets all sitting in one place. Not all databases are a bunch of excel spreadsheets sitting in one place, but it is a reasonable idea for this class.
