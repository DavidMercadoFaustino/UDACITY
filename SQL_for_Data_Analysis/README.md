# Introduction
 The Structured Query Language or just SQL is used all over the place beyond the databases. With that being said, SQL is most popular for its interaction with databases. You can think of a database as a bunch of excel spreadsheets all sitting in one place. Not all databases are a bunch of excel spreadsheets sitting in one place.

## Why Do Data Analysts Use SQL?
The five most apparent are:

* SQL is easy to understand.
* Traditional databases allow us to access data directly.
* Traditional databases allow us to audit and replicate our data.
* SQL is a great tool for analyzing multiple tables at once.
* SQL allows you to analyze more complex questions than dashboard tools like Google Analytics.
* You will experience these advantages first hand, as we learn to write SQL to interact with data.

## Why Businesses Like Databases

* Data integrity is ensured - only the data you want entered is entered, and only certain users are able to enter data into the database.

* Data can be accessed quickly - SQL allows you to obtain results very quickly from the data stored in a database. Code can be optimized to quickly pull results.

* Data is easily shared - multiple individuals can access data stored in a database, and the data is the same for all users allowing for consistent results for anyone with access to your database.
